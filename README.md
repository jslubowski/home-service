# Home Service application
This application is currently at the beggining of the development. It is based on the Home Assistant application for the Raspberry.  The idea is to create a home control hub, whic would run on a Raspberry Pi with touch screen attached. For now, all that is being implemented is a backend Java Spring application. The main directory will be populated by multiple microservices.
